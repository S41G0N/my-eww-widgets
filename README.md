# my-eww-widgets

## Getting Started

This is a collection of my custom widgets in [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww). Feel free to use them and modify them according to your wishes.

## Project Prerequisites & Setup
These are the prerequisites used by the essential scripts, make sure to install them to make the widgets work properly:

- **Hyprland**: A tiling window manager this widget was designed for
- **Hyprlang**: Hyprlang should be included by default when Hyprland is installed
- **eww**: The ElKowar's Wacky Widgets.
- **jq**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor
- **socat**: Multipurpose relay (SOcket CAT).
- **pipewire**: A server and user space API to handle multimedia pipelines.
- **wireplumber**: A modular session and policy manager for PipeWire.
- **system76-power**: A system76 power management tool

Ensure you have these tools installed on your system to proceed with the setup and usage of this project.
